## The general public's trust has been broken by car manufacturers 

- Events like the VW emissions and fuel consumption scandal have damaged the reputation of car manufacturers
- The general public is right to question the emission and fuel consumption numbers spruiked by these unscrupulous operators
- In order to make the process of finding the truth around manufacturer claims easier, we have developed an app that compares the stated fuel consumption quoted by the manufacturer against a model that predicts what a car with the same characteristics generally achieves in terms of fuel consumption

## The Application: Inputs and Outputs

- The user interface is styled as follows. All input parameters are labelled and described in the application.

## Application Data Model

- The Model to predict from a car's MPG efficiency is built on the mtcars dataset that is included in the standard R distribution.

```{r}
library(datasets)
head(mtcars, 5)
```
